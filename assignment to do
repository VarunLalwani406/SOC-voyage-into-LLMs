# Digit Recognizer with PyTorch

## Objective
Implement a digit recognizer model using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Description
The MNIST dataset is a widely used collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). Your task is to build a digit recognizer model using the PyTorch library that can accurately classify these digits.

## Requirements
1. **Data Loading:** Load the MNIST dataset using PyTorch's data loading utilities.
2. **Model Definition:** Create a neural network model for digit recognition. You can use a simple feedforward neural network.
3. **Training:** Train your model on the training set of the MNIST dataset. Use an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
4. **Validation:** Evaluate the performance of your model on a separate validation set. Report metrics such as accuracy.
5. **Testing:** Test your trained model on a test set that was not used during training or validation.
6. **Visualization:** Visualize a few input images along with their corresponding predicted and actual labels.

## Guidelines
- Use **Colab Notebook only** for writing the code.
- Use PyTorch for model implementation, training, and evaluation.
- Document your code clearly with comments for better understanding.
- Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance.
- Include a brief report in comments summarizing your model's architecture, training process, and performance.

## Deliverables
1. Python code in a Colab Notebook implementing the digit recognizer model.
2. A brief report in comments itself documenting your model's architecture, training process, and performance metrics.

## Resources
- [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html)
- [MNIST dataset in PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.MNIST.html#torchvision.datasets.MNIST)

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Model Accuracy:** How well does your model perform on the test set?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, documented, and easy to understand?
- **Experimentation:** Have you experimented with different model architectures and hyperparameters?
- **Visualization:** Did you provide visualizations to help understand the model's predictions?

**Note:** Feel free to explore additional features or techniques to enhance your digit recognizer model. Good luck!
