<h2>Weekly Learning Progress</h2>

<b>Week 1</b><br>
- Started with a <b>Python refresher</b> tutorial to get comfortable with the language again.<br>
- Learned <b>NumPy</b> and basic data operations:<br>
&emsp;• Creating arrays, indexing, slicing, reshaping, iterating, joining, splitting, searching, sorting, filtering.<br>
&emsp;• Explored <b>Ufuncs</b> for element-wise operations.<br>
- Studied <b>Pandas</b>, <b>Matplotlib</b>, and <b>PyTorch</b> using resources shared by my mentor and official documentation.<br><br>

<b>Week 2</b><br>
- Explored fundamentals of <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>: text processing, language modeling, and sentiment analysis.<br>
- Learned about <b>Regular Expressions (Regex)</b>:<br>
&emsp;• Rule-based pattern matching tool to extract/manipulate text.<br>
&emsp;• E.g., <code>\d+</code> matches digits, <code>\bcat\b</code> matches the word “cat” but not “category”.<br>
- Studied <b>Word Embeddings</b>:<br>
&emsp;• Methods like <b>TF-IDF</b>, <b>Skip-gram</b>, <b>CBOW</b>, and tools like <b>GloVe</b>, <b>FastText</b>.<br>
- Practiced <b>Text Preprocessing</b> techniques to clean and prepare raw data.<br>
- Performed <b>Sentiment Analysis</b> to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.<br>
- Compared <b>NLTK</b> vs <b>spaCy</b>:<br>
&emsp;• NLTK is good for experimentation and research.<br>
&emsp;• spaCy is better for production and real-world applications.<br>
- Worked on <b>text processing using both NLTK and spaCy</b>.<br><br>

<b>Weeks 3–4</b><br>
- Watched 4 visual explanation videos by <b>3Blue1Brown</b> to understand concepts deeply.<br>
- Started the <b>Neural Networks and Deep Learning</b> course (60% completed).<br>
- Learned about <b>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</b> to process sequence data.<br>
- Gained deeper understanding of:<br>
&emsp;• <b>Python classes</b> – for writing modular, reusable code.<br>
&emsp;• <b>Optimizers</b> – for minimizing loss in training deep learning models.<br><br>

Currently continuing with <b>Week 4 resources</b> and applying the concepts in practice.
