# ðŸ¤– PDF Chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project implements a simple chatbot that can answer questions from any PDF (e.g., UG Rulebook) using RAG architecture.

## âœ… Features
- Uses `google/flan-t5-large` (no Hugging Face token needed)
- Parses PDF with `pdfplumber`
- Embeds chunks with `sentence-transformers`
- Stores embeddings in `FAISS`
- Simple UI via `Gradio`

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Setup

Place your `ug_rulebook.pdf` or any other PDF inside the working directory or upload it manually.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -U langchain langchain-community pdfplumber gradio transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu accelerate
    ```

2. Run the notebook: `pdf_chatbot_rag.ipynb`

3. Ask questions about your PDF! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“Œ Example Questions (UG Rulebook)
